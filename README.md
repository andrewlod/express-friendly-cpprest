```

### Using the library
- Copy the `include` directory generated by the build stage into your desired include directory
- Make sure the `.dll` file inside the `lib` directory generated by the build stage is copied into the same directory as your executable
- Copy the `.lib` file to your binary directory and link it on your `CMakeLists.txt`
